C# Barcode Scanner

Building a barcode scanning application in .NET MAUI using the IronBarCode library to process and decode barcodes from images. This repository contains an example of a .NET MAUI application capable of selecting, displaying, and decoding barcodes from images.

Steps to Build a Barcode Scanning Application in .NET MAUI

Step 1: Download the Project

Clone or download this repository to a location on your disk. Open the solution file using Visual Studio.

Step 2: Rebuild Solution

Rebuild the solution to ensure all necessary dependencies and NuGet packages are properly installed and configured.

Step 3: Add UI Elements

In this application, the user can select an image containing a barcode, scan it to extract its data and copy it to the clipboard. The UI elements are organized as follows:

Select Barcode

A button allows users to select an image containing a barcode from their device.

<Button
    x:Name="ImageSelect"
    Text="Select Barcode"
    BackgroundColor="#3498db"
    TextColor="White"
    SemanticProperties.Hint="Select Image"
    Clicked="SelectBarcode"
    HorizontalOptions="Center"
    CornerRadius="8"
    Padding="20,10" />

Display Selected Image

An image element displays the selected image to the user.

<Image
    x:Name="barcodeImage"
    SemanticProperties.Description="Selected Barcode"
    HeightRequest="200"
    HorizontalOptions="Center"
    Margin="0,20,0,0"/>

Scan and Copy Barcode Data

Two buttons allow the user to scan the barcode to extract its data and copy the data to the clipboard.

<HorizontalStackLayout
    HorizontalOptions="Center"
    Spacing="20">

    <!-- Scan Barcode Button -->
    <Button
        x:Name="scanBarcode"
        Text="Scan Barcode"
        BackgroundColor="#3498db"
        TextColor="White"
        SemanticProperties.Hint="Scan Barcode"
        WidthRequest="150"
        Clicked="ScanBarcode"
        CornerRadius="8"
        Padding="10,10" />

    <!-- Copy Text Button -->
    <Button
        x:Name="copyText"
        Text="Copy"
        BackgroundColor="#3498db"
        TextColor="White"
        SemanticProperties.Hint="Copy Text"
        WidthRequest="150"
        Clicked="CopyEditorText"
        CornerRadius="8"
        Padding="10,10" />

</HorizontalStackLayout>

Display Barcode Data

An editor element displays the extracted barcode data to the user.

<Editor x:Name="outputText"
        Placeholder="Output text"
        HeightRequest="100"
        WidthRequest="500"
        IsReadOnly="True"
        BackgroundColor="White"
        TextColor="#333333"
        Margin="0,20,0,0" />

Step 4: Implement Barcode Scanning Functionality

In the code-behind file MainPage.xaml.cs, implement the functionality for selecting an image, scanning the barcode, and copying the barcode data to the clipboard. The IronBarCode library is used to decode the barcode from the selected image.

private async void ScanBarcode(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            try
            {
                var imageSource = (FileImageSource)barcodeImage.Source;
                if (imageSource == null)
                {
                    await DisplayAlert("Alert", "Please select an image first!", "OK");
                    return;
                }

                var barcodeResults = BarcodeReader.Read(imageSource.File);
                if (barcodeResults != null && barcodeResults.Any())
                {
                    var result = barcodeResults.First().Text;
                    outputText.Text = result;
                }
                else
                {
                    await DisplayAlert("Alert", "No barcode detected!", "OK");
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                await DisplayAlert("Error", ex.Message, "OK");
            }
        }
    }


Execution and Output

Once you've followed the steps above to build the barcode scanning application, you can now run the app to see it in action.

Build and Run the Application: Ensure that you have set the appropriate target platform in Visual Studio. Press F5 or click on the Run button in Visual Studio to build and run the application.

Select a Barcode: Click on the Select Barcode button to open the file picker and select an image containing a barcode from your device.

Scan the Barcode: After selecting an image, click on the Scan Barcode button. The application will process the image, decode the barcode, and display the barcode data in the output text editor below.

Copy Barcode Data: If you wish to copy the barcode data, click on the Copy button. A success alert will appear confirming that the text has been copied to the clipboard.

The barcode data will be displayed in the output text editor. You can now use this data as needed for other purposes within or outside of the app. If any errors occur during the process, such as if no barcode is detected or if the image selection is canceled, appropriate alert messages will be displayed to guide you on the next steps.

Conclusion

This Barcode Scanning application in .NET MAUI demonstrates a practical use of the IronBarCode library to process and decode barcodes from selected images. By following the outlined steps, developers can easily replicate, understand, and build upon this example to create robust barcode scanning solutions or integrate barcode scanning functionality into their existing .NET MAUI applications.

The intuitive UI and error handling ensure a user-friendly experience, making the app suitable for a wide range of barcode scanning and decoding purposes. The modular code structure and comments also provide a clear understanding of the implementation, promoting further exploration and customization to meet specific project requirements. This example serves as a solid foundation for anyone looking to delve into barcode scanning in .NET MAUI or enhance their projects with barcode processing capabilities.
